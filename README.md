Sina SEMSEG is a user-friendly toolkit for building deep convolutional neural networks tailored to semantic segmentation tasks. It features a graphical interface and automatic debugger, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. 

## Getting started

1. **Launch Colab:**  
   Open [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com), sign in with your Google account, and upload `SinaSEMSEGToolkit.ipynb`.

2. **Run setup cells:**  
   Click the play icons on the left of each cell to run the initial installation.

3. **Upload data:**  
   After setup finishes, upload your images and masks to Colab’s file browser. You can drag and drop files from your computer.

4. **Train and segment:**  
   Run the remaining cells to create or load a pretrained model, train it, and perform semantic segmentation.
   
   _Don’t worry—the user-friendly interface provides step-by-step guidance for all configurations._
